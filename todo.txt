to-do:
 * translate script engine variables
 * idnum2itemdesctable.txt and itemInfo.lua
   a separate executable in the build chain
   item_db.txt -> db -> ic -> fmt -> output

maybe:
 * inno setup for windows installer
 * rpm package for red hat (fedora, centos)
 * deb package for ubuntu and debian
 * osx package for osx
 * autotool / cmake for linux and osx

major:
i plan on creating a grf library and tool for the purpose
of trying my hand at developing a gui application without
c# and implementing another file format

also i plan on creating a simple item database web
application that servers can use, but mostly it is
for showing off the eadb.compiler project
