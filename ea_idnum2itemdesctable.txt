[Kunlun The Hermit Land]
Kunlun is a land in the clouds.
Being so high in the air affords an unprecedented view of the world, it also gives
a different mindset to those whom allow themselves to think freely.
The Statue of Kunlun's Greatest Philosopher, stands proudly in the middle of town, ready to inspire great thoughts from all those that gaze upon him.
All around Kunlun are spectacular Overlooks of the World.
But there are particular spots that are exceptionally breathtaking, please watch your step.
There is a small hill in Kunlun that is said to of been the Great Philosophers favorite meditation spot, you should visit there and see if any grand thoughts take you.
No matter how great a culture is, there will always be a few among its citizenry that just don't 'get it'.
Those in Kunlun's history that always thought small eventually truly shrank, and eventually disappeared.
But before that time they had a Mini-town that they lived in on ground beneath Kunlun.
That place is an object lesson against stagnant thinking.
